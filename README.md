Inception Attendance Recorder App


Problem Statement:
Inception Guide is a coaching center situated in a town Veraval. They face a lot of issues taking attendance of students manually and keeping track of it.

Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a “Attendance Recorder” to keep track of the attendance. Its features include adding a class/lecture of a particular subject on a given day, add special note for any special class, record attendance for that class and also search from previous classes.


Functionality & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the faculty record attendance easily.
Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :

Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.

RecyclerView : To present the list of different classes we used the efficient recyclerview. 

Room Database : We have used Room database to store attendance data locally.

Application Link & Future Scope :

The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase with the coaching center.

Once the app is fully tested and functional in coaching center, we plan to talk to our college and also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them for this app.
